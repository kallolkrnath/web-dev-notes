## Suggested learning path

1. **HTML** → [html-note/](./html-note/) — Structure and content.
2. **CSS** → [css-note/](./css-note/) — Styling and layout.
3. **JavaScript** → [javascript-note/](./javascript-note/) — Interactivity and logic.
4. **TypeScript** (optional but recommended) → [typescript-note/](./typescript-note/) — Type safety and tooling.
5. **React** → [react-note/](./react-note/) — Component-based UI.
6. **Next.js** → [nextjs-note/](./nextjs-note/) — Full-stack React framework.
7. **WPO** → [wpo-note/](./wpo-note/) — Performance and Core Web Vitals.

Use **WPO** concepts throughout (e.g. when building with React/Next.js) rather than only at the end.
